# hexprism-language-made-with-js
## -- Work in Progress --
I have learned these skills through multiple documentation resources, as well as videos.

Custom programming language called HexPrism
* Dynamically typed
* High level language
* Easy syntax

## Some basic syntax in the future works
### Some syntax examples
```
operation buildFunction() -> {
  // Your code here
}

for (1 thru 2000) {
  // Your code here
}

set myArray to [1, 2, 3]

for (item thru myArray) {
  // Your code here
}
```
